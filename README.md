**References:**
- [Verlet Collision with Impulse Preservation](http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/nov/29/verlet-collision-with-impulse-preservation/), an excellent physics tutorial by Florian Boesch. Approach to solving instability when objects are at rest.

- [Physics for Games, Animations, and Simulations with HTML5 by Dev Ramtel and Adrian Dobre, ISBN-13: 978-1-4302-6338-8](https://github.com/devramtal/Physics-for-JavaScript-Games-Animation-Simulations). A great reference for starting out with physics simulations in JavaScript. Made modifications to angled wall collision algorithm for multiple ball stability.
